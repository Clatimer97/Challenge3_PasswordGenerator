# Challenge3_PasswordGenerator

## Description of Project
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive random password generator using Javascript. 

## Process 
* Created arrays for all of the given parameters: uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers
* Utilized the `generatePassword()` given within the `writePassword()` to create the functional part of the password generator
* Created variables for the confirm windows to pop up since they have Boolean values (true/false)
* Created alerts with if/else if statements to prevent password generator from failing and to make user abide by parameters
* Created empty array for all of the other values within charUpper, charLower, specialChar, and Number variables to be stored
* Created empty string statement for the final password's value
* Used if statement to set a parameter that if the value of the input is true to utilize the concat function, otherwise it is null(false)
* Iteration statement used for the user input window (window.prompt) value of var fifth to set parameters for input
* Math floor and math random used to randomize values from the userChoice array
* Return finalPassword used to create string value for empty var finalPassword 
* console.log used for entirety of function to ensure functionality and absence of mistakes are logged in the console
